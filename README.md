# 📚 How to Create a GitHub Portfolio

Hi there, I'm Katie! 🙋🏻‍♀️

This is a **fuss-free, simple** guide to create your GitHub portfolio. 

It's perfect for
- Beginners in data science who wants to showcase samples of work, or projects.
- Serves as a digital resume and proof that you have the skills in your resume. 
- A fun way to keep track of your projects.

**Why I created this repo?**
- I was once intimidated by GitHub myself. I signed up for an account in July and left it aside as I did not understand how it works.
- Since then, I have learnt how to use it (I'm quite obsessed with writing in Markdowns 😆), so I would love to share this knowledge with everyone. 🙂

## Introduction 

Let's understand some of the alien terms that you will see on GitHub.

`Repository/repo` means `folder`. It is similar to creating folders on your computer. Each repository represents one folder. You can create multiple repositories for different projects. 

`README.md` is a default note, or summary that is usually included in each repo. It acts as the "homepage" of your repo where you can introduce the project,  provide a summary, or anything - so feel free to write it.

## How to Create Your Profile?

**Are you interested in creating a Profile that appears on your GitHub homepage, _like mine_?**

**Step 1: Click on `New Repository` on the top right of the page.**

<kbd><img width="257" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135068335-12538e85-8090-4f27-8232-47bfcc15b2c2.png"></kbd>

**Step 2: Create a new repository with the _exact name as your username_.**

My username is "**katiehuangx**", so I created a new repository named "**katiehuangx**". This repository will contain the write-up of your profile.

<kbd><img width="741" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-28 at 6 15 33 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135102196-6eeea30a-a874-4fb3-a4f6-25db97d6c825.png"></kbd>

The format of the file is `Markdown (.md)`. Its default name is `README.md`, so you can leave it as that.

**Step 3: To edit your Profile or Markdown file, hover over the pencil ✏️ icon on your right and click `Edit this file`.**

**Now you can start to write your profile! 😄**

### What to write in your profile?

It's entirely up to you and your creativity! Most people would include:
- Introduction
- Skills like Data Analysis, SQL, Python, Tableau, Web Development, etc
- Fancier things like visitor count, clickable icons, etc
- Projects that you're proud of

## How to Customize Markdown files?

GitHub's Markdown guides are excellent and comprehensive enough, yet easily understandable to customize your Markdown files. This is where I learn to customize mine too. 🙂

## How to Create New Repository?

Creating a new repo is as easy as creating your profile.

**Step 1: Click on `New Repository` on the top right of the page.**

<kbd><img width="257" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135068335-12538e85-8090-4f27-8232-47bfcc15b2c2.png"></kbd>

The image below is the default setting. If you forgot to tick `Add a README.md`, you can create the file separately in the repo later.

And, it's done. You have created your first repo! 😎

### Extra Tip: How to Create Subfolders in your Repository?
