# 📚 How to Create a GitHub Portfolio

Hi there, I'm Katie! 🙋🏻‍♀️

This is a **fuss-free, simple** guide to create your GitHub portfolio. 

It's perfect for
- Beginners in data science who wants to showcase samples of work, or projects.
- Serves as a digital resume and proof that you have the skills in your resume. 
- A fun way to keep track of your projects.

**Why I created this repo?**
- I was once intimidated by GitHub myself. I signed up for an account in July and left it aside as I did not understand how it works.
- Since then, I have learnt how to use it (I'm quite obsessed with writing in Markdowns 😆), so I would love to share this knowledge with everyone. 🙂

- [How to Customize Markdown files?](#how-to-customize-markdown-files)
- [How to Create New Repository?](#how-to-create-new-repository)

_You can learn how to do this neat table of contents too! It's very easy. 😉_

## Introduction 

Let's understand some of the alien terms that you will see on GitHub.

`Repository/repo` means `folder`. It is similar to creating folders on your computer. Each repository represents one folder. You can create multiple repositories for different projects. 

`README.md` is a default note, or summary that is usually included in each repo. It acts as the "homepage" of your repo where you can introduce the project,  provide a summary, or anything - so feel free to write it.

You do not need to download the GitHub Desktop for this. Your browser would do the job just fine. 🙂

## How to Create Your Profile?

**Are you interested in creating a Profile that appears on your GitHub homepage, _like mine_?**

**Step 1: Click on `+` and `New Repository` at top right of the page.**

<kbd><img width="257" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135068335-12538e85-8090-4f27-8232-47bfcc15b2c2.png"></kbd>

**Step 2: Create a new repository with the _exact name as your username_.**

My username is "**katiehuangx**", so I created a new repository named "**katiehuangx**". This repository will contain the write-up of your profile.

<kbd><img width="741" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-28 at 6 15 33 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135102196-6eeea30a-a874-4fb3-a4f6-25db97d6c825.png"></kbd>

The format of the file is `Markdown (.md)`. Its default name is `README.md`, so you can leave it as that. 

<kbd><img width="720" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-28 at 6 18 40 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135102549-9bc47d7f-d803-4cc2-a8a2-361c900a6b96.png"></kbd>

**Step 3: To edit your Profile or Markdown file, hover over the `pencil ✏️` icon on your right and click `Edit this file`.**

<kbd><img width="354" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-28 at 10 29 37 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135107847-f86bef5c-2f26-4942-9de2-104c446825e1.png"></kbd>

**Now you can start to write your profile! 😄 Once you're happy with the contents, scroll down and click `Commit changes`.**

### What to write in your profile?

It's entirely up to you and your creativity! Most people would include:
- An introduction of yourself
- Skills like Data Analysis, SQL, Python, Tableau, Web Development, etc
- Fancier things like visitor count, clickable icons, etc (can't help you with this as I've not learn it yet 😅)
- Projects that you're proud of

## How to Customize Markdown files?

GitHub's Markdown guides are excellent and comprehensive enough, yet easily understandable. This is where I learn to customize mine too. 🙂

- How to customize Markdown files - [Github Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
- How to create tables - [GitHub Organizing information with tables](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/organizing-information-with-tables)
- How to colour code your SQL, Python, etc code blocks (This is my favourite part!) - [GitHub Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks)
- **Bonus tip**: How to add emojis? 🌟🙌🏻🙋🏻‍♀️📚🌤🐶
  - For Windows: Windows logo key + . (period)
  - For Mac: Control + Command + Spacebar

### 🌌 Add Images

Normally what I would do is take a screenshot, or download the image. 

Then, I **copy the image file** and **paste in the Markdown file** itself. Give it around 3-5 seconds to load the image. 

<kbd><img width="619" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135247149-4cddb744-cc6e-4b20-92fa-fd768da95d7f.png"></kbd>

**Uploading screenshot...**

<kbd><img width="417" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135276525-a3b870af-8ece-494f-b1cb-be843ce18602.png"></kbd>

**Successfully uploaded screenshot!**

**Click `Preview` to check your newly uploaded image.**

<kbd><img width="476" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-29 at 5 58 48 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135276747-73e27341-bfcf-4b32-9a8f-92deedc067c5.png"></kbd>

### 📚 Add Table of Contents

Below is the code block for my table of contents. 

````
## Table of Contents
- [How to Create Your Profile?](#how-to-create-your-profile)
- [How to Customize Markdown files?](#how-to-customize-markdown-files)
- [How to Create New Repository?](#how-to-create-new-repository)
````

To ensure that you retrieve the correct `(#xx-xx-xx)`:

**Click on the chain logo beside your title. Right click and open in new tab.**
<img width="508" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-29 at 6 04 22 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135248350-9ba54965-863e-4408-8e02-eb8cd596c2a8.png">

**Navigate to the website link and scroll all the way to the end and copy the highlighted `##xx-xx-xx`.**
<img width="678" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-29 at 6 04 57 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135248359-2ed3ea2e-2a8b-4f07-8f7c-80b053d42497.png">

Do not include emojis in your title, otherwise the links in the table of contents would not work.

### 🧱 Colour Code the Code Blocks

If you've seen my [8 Week SQL Challenge repo](https://github.com/katiehuangx/8-Week-SQL-Challenge), I use colour codes for my SQL syntax. It's very easy to do and makes your syntax look professional too.

````
```sql -- Add 3 backticks followed by sql
SELECT *
FROM student_info
WHERE student_name = 'Katie';
``` -- Add 3 backticks
````

This is how it will turn out:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM student_info
WHERE student_name = 'Katie';
```

## How to Create New Repository?

Creating a new repo is as easy as creating your profile.

**Step 1: Click on `New Repository` at the top right of the page.**

<kbd><img width="257" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135068335-12538e85-8090-4f27-8232-47bfcc15b2c2.png"></kbd>

The image below is the default setting. If you forgot to tick `Add a README.md`, you can create the file separately in the repo later.

<kbd><img width="615" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-28 at 9 55 20 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135103549-c7d87461-adb5-4b6c-b65b-72842e2f374c.png"></kbd>

And, it's done. You have created your first repo! 😎

### Extra: How to Create Subfolders in your Repository?

**Step 1: Navigate to the right side of the page. Click `Add File` and `Create New File`.**

<kbd><img width="879" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-28 at 10 41 20 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135109960-52721c55-810e-47d9-a463-8c19d9ece947.png"></kbd>

**Step 2: Name your file followed by the extension `.md`, or your desired format.**

<kbd><img width="610" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-28 at 10 42 05 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135110652-99d4b7da-9339-4324-b564-5d217bf4cfbd.png"></kbd>

### Extra: How to Upload Projects in your Repository?

**Step 1: Navigate to the right side of the page. Click `Add File` and `Upload File`.**

<kbd><img width="397" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135250389-cece0d81-19fa-4021-beb1-2bd4fb3bc09c.png"></kbd>

**Step 2: `Choose your file`, wait for file to load completely and click `Commit changes`**

Once your file is uploaded completely, it will look like the one in my screenshot below. Bigger file size would take a longer time to load. 🙂

<kbd><img width="1052" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-29 at 6 19 34 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135250662-8d19c9b6-7b57-4e15-90da-efd174d5d8a0.png"></kbd>

And, that's it! It's as simple as that!
