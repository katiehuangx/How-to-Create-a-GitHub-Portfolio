# 📚 How to Create a GitHub Portfolio

Hi there, I'm Katie! 🙋🏻‍♀️

This is a fuss-free, simple guide to create your GitHub portfolio. 

It's perfect for
- Beginners in data science who wants to showcase samples of work, or projects.
- Serves as a digital resume and proof you have the skills in your resume. 
- A fun way to keep track of your projects.
- You do not need to understand how to code to do this, trust me. I'm a non-coder myself.

## Introduction 

Let's understand some of the alien terms that you will see on GitHub.

`Repository/repo` means `folder`. It is similar to creating folders on your computer. Each repository represents one folder. You can create multiple repositories for different projects. 

`Fork` means `copy`. By `forking` another person's repo, you are making a copy of that person's repo where you can edit the contents and any changes will only be reflected in your copy of the repo and will not be reflected in other person's repo.

`README.md` is a default note, or summary usually included in each repo. It acts as the "homepage" of your repo where you can introduce the project and provide a summary of the analysis. It can be anything, really - so feel free to write it up!

**Why I created this repo?**
- I was once intimidated by GitHub myself. I signed up for an account in July and left it aside as I did not understand how it works.
- Since then, I have learnt how to use it (and I'm quite obsessed with repos now 😆), I would love to share this knowledge with everyone. 🙂

## How to Create Your Profile?

**Are you interested in creating a Profile that appears on your GitHub homepage, _like mine_?**

1. Firstly, **click on `New Repository`** on top right of the page.

2. Next, **create a new repository** with the _**exact name as your username**_.

My username is "**katiehuangx**", hence I created a new repository "**katiehuangx**". This repository will contain the write-up of your profile.

The format of the profile is a `Markdown (.md)` file. The default name is `README.md` so you can leave it as that.

3. To **edit a Markdown file**, hover over the pencil ✏️ icon and click `Edit this file`.

**Now you can start to write up your profile! 😄**

### What to write in your profile?

It's entirely up to you and your creativity! Most people would include
- Introduction
- Skills (i.e. Data Analysis, SQL, Python, Tableau, Excel, etc)
- Fancier things (i.e. visitor count, preview of other websites, etc (I will not teach this as I'm not good in techy stuffs 😆)
- Social media accounts
- Projects you're proud of! 😄

## How to Create New Repository?

Creating a new repo is as easy as creating your profile.

Firstly, click on `New Repository` on top right of the page. 

<img width="257" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135068335-12538e85-8090-4f27-8232-47bfcc15b2c2.png">

This is the default setting. If you forgot to tick `Add README.md`, you can create it in the repo itself later.

<img width="615" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-28 at 9 55 20 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/135103549-c7d87461-adb5-4b6c-b65b-72842e2f374c.png">

And, it's done! You have created your first repo! 

### How to Create Subfolders in your Repository?

1. Go on the right side of the page, click `Add File` and `Create New File`.

2. Next, `name your file` followed by the extension `.md`, `.sql`, or any format.
